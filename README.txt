#About
This repo contains the keymaps for my custom mechanical keyboards. Currently only the GMMK Pro is supported,
though other custom keymaps will be created in the future as I build and mod more keyboards. 

##What are Keymaps?
Keymaps are custom firmware that allows you to completely customize exactly how you want your keyboard to function.
For instance, my caps lock key acts as a layer, rather than caps lock (because who uses caps lock?). Keymaps also let you
adjust the aesthetics of a keyboard through remapping keys or setting RGB matricies for compatible PCBs.

##How do I use this?
Download the keymap and the compile it using QMK MSYS or another piece of QMK compiler software. After creating the
hex and bin files, use QMK Toolbox and put your keyboard into boot mode. Flash the bin/hex onto your keyboard and
your new custom keymap firmware should be onto your keyboard!

###Enjoy!
